// alive on Android, but only the store-INDEPENDENT ones live here (the redux store + engines stay in
// MainViewController — on iOS the single root view controller is already app-lifetime, so there is no
// store-lifetime reason to hoist them; see the plan's "host stays light" decision). What MUST be
// process-global: the CL/UN delegates + controllers (their OS .delegate refs are weak → a local delegate
// deallocates and callbacks silently stop) and the shared ContentStore. Swift calls IosNotifGlue.shared.*
// from AppDelegate.didFinishLaunching (main thread). Geofence controller + BGTask wiring land in S3.
