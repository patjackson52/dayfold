## TASK-KMP — Restructure apps/client into a true KMP module (prerequisite)

**Status:** ready (next session). **Blocks:** TASK-SYNC step 2+ (Android offline
DB) and the **iOS** shell. **Why:** today `apps/androidApp` borrows `apps/client`
source via `srcDir` — which **can't carry SQLDelight's per-variant generated
code** (proven in TASK-SYNC step 1), and there's no iOS target. The fix is to
make `apps/client` a real Compose-Multiplatform module: `commonMain` (shared
logic + UI) + `androidTarget` / `jvm("desktop")` / iOS targets.

**Scope:**
1. Convert `apps/client` to `kotlin("multiplatform")` + `com.android.library` +
   `org.jetbrains.compose` + `kotlin.plugin.compose`. Source sets: `commonMain`
   (Model, Reducer, Selectors, CardRender, FeedScreen, FeedApp, ContentStore,
   SyncClient), `androidMain` (driver + WorkManager), `desktopMain` (Main.kt +
   JdbcSqliteDriver), `iosMain` (NativeSqliteDriver + BGTaskScheduler glue).
2. **SQLDelight in commonMain** (`generateAsync`? no — sync drivers); remove the
   `srcDir` borrow + the `ContentStore`/`Main.kt` excludes in `apps/androidApp`
   (which becomes a thin `:androidApp` depending on `:client`, or fold the
   Android entry into `androidMain` + an `application` module).
3. **HTTP cross-platform:** `SyncClient` currently uses `java.net.HttpURLConnection`
   (works on desktop+Android, **NOT iOS**). Swap to **ktor-client** (`cio`/`okhttp`
   desktop+android, `darwin` iOS) in commonMain — or keep an `expect/actual`
   HTTP fn. ktor is the clean call.
4. iOS app target (needs the operator's Mac/Xcode — escalate that part).

**Gotchas already solved (don't re-derive — see `processes/agent-dev-loop.md`):**
redux-kotlin alpha01 on Kotlin **2.3.20**; `store.selectorState{}` is an
**extension**; `redux-kotlin-granular` added explicitly; SQLDelight **2.3.2** +
**sqlite-3-38 dialect** (UPSERT); devtools `debugImplementation` inapp /
`releaseImplementation` inapp-noop; JDK 17; compose-MP **1.9.3** (watch the
AGP↔Kotlin↔compose-MP matrix when it becomes a KMP+android-library build).

**DoD:** one `:client` KMP module; `commonMain` holds all shared code incl.
SQLDelight + sync; android/desktop build from it (no srcDir, no excludes); tests
+ snapshots still green; iOS target compiles (run gated on Mac).

## TASK-SYNC — Persistence & Sync (offline-first client) · ADR 0020

**Status:** IN PROGRESS. **Done (2026-06-19):** step 1 — SQLDelight DB layer
(`Content.sq` cards+sync_meta, 3.38 dialect for UPSERT) + `ContentStore` wrapper
(applyDelta txn / activeCards / cursor) + 3 tests green on desktop; **SQLDelight
toolchain proven on Kotlin 2.3.20**. **Remaining:** (2) wire the shared DB into
the **Android** compile — the `srcDir` code-sharing can't carry SQLDelight's
per-variant generated code, so this wants the **proper KMP restructure** of
`apps/client` (commonMain + android/jvm/ios targets); (3) rewrite `SyncClient`
network→DB; (4) DB→store bridge + cold-start; (5) foreground poll + WorkManager/
BGTaskScheduler. **Why now:** the shipped M0 client is
**in-memory** — round-trips the network every open, no offline, no background
refresh, no persisted cursor. ADR 0020 + `specs/prototype/08-mobile-client.md`
§"Data freshness & offline-first sync" spec the target.

**Scope (build slice):**
1. **SQLDelight (KMP)** as source of truth — drivers per platform
   (`AndroidSqliteDriver` / `NativeSqliteDriver` iOS / `JdbcSqliteDriver` desktop);
   tables = content (cards at M0) + `sync_meta(cursor, last_synced_at)`; WAL.
2. **Sync engine** (`commonMain`) — rewrite `SyncClient` to write the DB in ONE
   transaction (upsert + tombstones + advance cursor); drain `has_more`
   (network → DB, not network → store).
3. **DB→store bridge** — SQLDelight reactive `Flow` → hydrate the redux store;
   `selectorState`/`FeedApp` unchanged (store = projection of DB).
4. **Cold-start** — hydrate store from DB first (instant, offline), then sync.
5. **Foreground poll loop** (~30–60 s, paused on background) + **Android
   `WorkManager`** + **iOS `BGTaskScheduler`** glue — all calling the shared engine.
6. **Tests** — offline-open (DB only), sync→DB→UI, background-sync writes DB,
   cursor survives restart. Verify via the snapshot/test loop + on-device.

**DoD:** opens instantly offline from cache; a foreground push reflects within one
poll interval; background sync keeps the next open fresh; `network→DB→store→UI`
holds. **Push (FCM/APNs/SSE) out of scope** (later milestone; same dataflow).
**Milestone:** next build slice after the M0 render.

## TASK-E2E — Investigate end-to-end encryption (privacy differentiator)

**Why now:** the server is a **dumb store that never processes content** (ADR
0004/0007), so E2E is structurally feasible: **CLI encrypts → server stores
blind ciphertext → device decrypts**. Privacy is a top selling point and this
would make it architectural, not policy. Investigation kicked off
2026-06-18 → `research/e2e-encryption-investigation.md` (agent in progress).

**Scope of the investigation:**
- What can be E2E (body_md, payload, titles, triggers, place coords) vs what
  must stay cleartext for routing (family_id, IDs, versions, timestamps).
- **Key management/distribution across the multi-member family + owner-approved
  invite + RFC 8628 device-grant flows** — how a family content key reaches
  each member device + each CLI credential **without the server seeing it**
  (passphrase-derived vs per-member public-key-wrapped vs sealed-sender).
- **Features sacrificed:** server-side `tsvector` FTS (→ client-side search),
  any server validation. Quantify the loss.
- **Recovery / key-loss** (E2E = lost key → lost data): recovery-phrase /
  key-backup UX + escrow tradeoffs.
- **Perf:** decrypt-each-time vs store-decrypted in the SQLDelight cache
  (on-device cache security).
- **KMP libraries** (libsodium/lazysodium, Tink, age) + maturity.
- **Threat model:** protects server breach; not device compromise; metadata
  leakage (sizes/timing/which-family).
- **Milestone:** likely **M0 E2E is easy** (single household, operator-only
  key); the hard part (multi-member key distribution) is M1. Recommend split.
- **ADR recommendation** (this is ADR-class — privacy posture + architecture).

DoD: a feasibility report the operator can decide go/no-go + milestone from;
if go, a Proposed ADR.
