## TASK-E2E — Investigate end-to-end encryption (privacy differentiator)

**Why now:** the server is a **dumb store that never processes content** (ADR
0004/0007), so E2E is structurally feasible: **CLI encrypts → server stores
blind ciphertext → device decrypts**. Privacy is a top selling point and this
would make it architectural, not policy. Investigation kicked off
2026-06-18 → `research/e2e-encryption-investigation.md` (agent in progress).

**Scope of the investigation:**
- What can be E2E (body_md, payload, titles, triggers, place coords) vs what
  must stay cleartext for routing (family_id, IDs, versions, timestamps).
- **Key management/distribution across the multi-member family + owner-approved
  invite + RFC 8628 device-grant flows** — how a family content key reaches
  each member device + each CLI credential **without the server seeing it**
  (passphrase-derived vs per-member public-key-wrapped vs sealed-sender).
- **Features sacrificed:** server-side `tsvector` FTS (→ client-side search),
  any server validation. Quantify the loss.
- **Recovery / key-loss** (E2E = lost key → lost data): recovery-phrase /
  key-backup UX + escrow tradeoffs.
- **Perf:** decrypt-each-time vs store-decrypted in the SQLDelight cache
  (on-device cache security).
- **KMP libraries** (libsodium/lazysodium, Tink, age) + maturity.
- **Threat model:** protects server breach; not device compromise; metadata
  leakage (sizes/timing/which-family).
- **Milestone:** likely **M0 E2E is easy** (single household, operator-only
  key); the hard part (multi-member key distribution) is M1. Recommend split.
- **ADR recommendation** (this is ADR-class — privacy posture + architecture).

DoD: a feasibility report the operator can decide go/no-go + milestone from;
if go, a Proposed ADR.
